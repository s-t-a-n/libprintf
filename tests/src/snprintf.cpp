 * Catch has two natural expression assertion macro's:
 * - REQUIRE() stops at first failure.
 * - CHECK() continues after failure.
 *
 * There are two variants to support decomposing negated expressions:
 * - REQUIRE_FALSE() stops at first failure.
 * - CHECK_FALSE() continues after failure.
 *
 * TEST_CASE( "Title here", "[short name]" ) {
 *     REQUIRE( [BOOLEAN CONDITION] ) ;
